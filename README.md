Key Features ✨

20 Progressive Levels: Covers the entire spectrum of Python knowledge, including fundamentals (Variables, Loops, Data Structures) and advanced topics (OOP, File I/O, Decorators).

Clear Theory & Syntax: Each level provides concise explanations, syntax highlights, and practical code snippets.

Visual Diagrams: Complex concepts are simplified with custom-designed visual diagrams to aid comprehension.

Real-World Analogies: Programming concepts are related to everyday scenarios for easier retention.

Interactive Challenges: Solve coding problems directly in the browser's "Interview Room" environment.

No Installation Required: Built entirely with front-end web technologies, making it immediately accessible.

Technologies Used 🛠️

HTML5: Application structure.

CSS3: Styling and layout.

JavaScript: Core game logic, level management, and front-end challenge validation.

(Simulated) Python: In-browser code evaluation logic (checks for required keywords and correct syntax structure).

How to Use and Play the Game 🕹️

Getting the game running is quick and easy, as it requires no server side setup.

1. Running Locally (Recommended)

Clone the Repository: Open your terminal or command prompt and clone the project from GitHub:

Bash
git clone [Project URL]
cd PythonZeroToHeroGame  # Navigate into your project folder
Open the Game: Simply locate the index.html file in your project folder and double-click it.

Start Learning: The game will open in your default web browser, and you can begin playing from Level 1.

2. Solving a Level Challenge

Each level follows a simple flow:

Read the Theory: Review the concept, syntax, and code snippet provided in the Theory section.

Analyze the Challenge: Read the Challenge description, which specifies the Python code you need to write.

Write Your Code: Enter your solution into the code editor provided on the page.

Submit: Click the "Check Code" or "Submit" button. The system checks if your code contains the necessary Python keywords and structure to pass the level.

Advance: Upon a successful check, you will unlock the next level.
