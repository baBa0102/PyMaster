## ✨ Key Features

* **20 Progressive Levels:** Covers the entire spectrum of Python knowledge, including fundamentals (Variables, Loops, Data Structures) and advanced topics (OOP, File I/O, Decorators).
* **Clear Theory & Syntax:** Each level provides concise explanations, syntax highlights, and practical code snippets.
* **Visual Diagrams:** Complex concepts are simplified with custom-designed visual diagrams to aid comprehension.
* **Real-World Analogies:** Programming concepts are related to everyday scenarios for easier retention.
* **Interactive Challenges:** Solve coding problems directly in the browser's "Interview Room" environment.
* **No Installation Required:** Built entirely with front-end web technologies, making it immediately accessible.

## 🕹️ How to Use and Play the Game

Getting the game running is quick and easy, as it requires no server-side setup.

### 1. Running Locally (Recommended)

1.  **Clone the Repository:**
    Open your terminal or command prompt and clone the project from GitHub. Remember to replace `[Your Repository URL Here]` with the actual URL of your GitHub repository.

    ```bash
    git clone [Your Repository URL Here]
    cd PythonZeroToHeroGame  # Navigate into your project folder
    ```

2.  **Open the Game:**
    Simply locate the `index.html` file in your `PythonZeroToHeroGame` project folder and double-click it.
3.  **Start Learning:**
    The game will open in your default web browser, and you can begin playing from Level 1.

### 2. Solving a Level Challenge

Each level follows a simple flow:

1.  **Read the Theory:** Review the concept, syntax, and code snippet provided in the **Theory** section.
2.  **Analyze the Challenge:** Read the **Challenge** description, which specifies the Python code you need to write.
3.  **Write Your Code:** Enter your solution into the code editor provided on the page.
4.  **Submit:** Click the **"Check Code"** or **"Submit"** button. The system checks if your code contains the necessary Python keywords and structure to pass the level.
5.  **Advance:** Upon a successful check, you will unlock the next level!
